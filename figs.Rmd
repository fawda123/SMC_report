1.	The new index works. [Demonstrate basic performance parameters, like lack of bias within reference sites, and good responsiveness to a few stressor gradients]
2.	The new index makes our region (or watersheds/land use classes) look good/bad [calculate extent of stream-miles in good/bad classes, based on reference percentiles; compare to results from earlier algae IBIs]
3.	The new index is complementary to the CSCI [demonstrate agreement, and/or insightful disagreements]
